<h1>About Musical Metrics</h1>

Musical Metrics is a set of 12 simple and creative music games that test the players' listening ability in various aspects of music and hearing, examining a diverse range of listening skills such as relative pitch and rhythmic recognition. The games are part of an ongoing research to explore hearing ability as a major component of a musician's progression.

The games are of various difficulty levels. Some are beginner-friendly and are accessible to people with no musical experience, while some test the capacity of even the most proficient musicians. A few games require a certain level of understanding of musical theory and terminology, but are nonetheless playable after a few practices.

Musical Metrics isn't only a useful tool for testing players' hearing ability, but also a great method of ear-training, all while having fun, whether that's competing with friends and family, or going against other musicians.
